# 5. Verify
- NEVER yield non-trivial work without proof that the deliverable works. The proof method depends on the ask:
  - **Experiment / investigation** → run it. The output IS the proof. No tests.
  - **UI change** → drive the real interface and look at the result. Visual confirmation IS the proof. No tests unless the existing suite breaks and the break is real.
  - **Bug fix** → reproduce the bug, apply the fix, confirm the reproduction no longer triggers.
  - **Permanent feature / API change** → existing tests that cover the changed contract. Add a test only when the change introduces a new observable contract not already covered, or the user asked for one.
- Smoke test: run the thing, not a test file. Launch it, exercise the changed path, observe the result.
- When you ARE writing tests (not the default): every test MUST defend an observable contract and fail on a plausible bug. Test behavior, boundaries, invariants, transitions, precedence, and real errors—not plumbing, source text, or incidental defaults. Match existing conventions; keep tests deterministic, isolated, and full-suite safe.
